#Advanvantage & DisAdvantage of VCS(gitHub)


Advanvantage:
Biggest advantage is branching process. Which makes life simple. I can have a branch which only goes for production.
If there is a experiment to be made we can create our own sandbox branch.  I can commit few things and rollback to were I was is greatest advantage too.

DisAdvantage:
Certain version of maven release plugin does not work well with git hub. I would call this as disadvantage of
VCS. When doing release:prepare  and other such steps. The maven release plugin would create a commit (Say if the
version was 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT release plugin would make a commit as 1.0.2 in the git hub) . So other developers
can start commiting to the new branch for next release. Git hub looks for atleast one approved message for any pull request/commit made.
The commit made by release plug in is fully automated. There is a work around for this problem. But this issue really made me worry.
